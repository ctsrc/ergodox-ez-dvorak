inspired by the key placement of the TypeMatrix 2030 USB.

## The what now?

I've been using the [Dvorak keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) since 2009/2010.
Back then I had a TypeMatrix 2030 USB. I stuck with
TypeMatrix most of the time between then and...
December 2017!

In December 2017, I bought an [ErgoDox EZ Shine](https://ergodox-ez.com)
(see [details below](#ergodox-ez-keyboard-model)).

Using the [Oryx configurator](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/oryx), 
I immediatelly created a custom layout for my ErgoDox EZ Shine.
A layout that was *heavily* inspired by the key placement on
my previous keyboard, the TypeMatrix 2030 USB.

Over time I've made small adjustments to my custom layout
in Oryx but the layout remains true to the TypeMatrix still.
Only, it's like, *a million times better*.

So anyway, time to put this configuration somewhere
rather than just relying on the ErgoDox EZ website
to stay up forever, eh? Hence this repo.

## Have a look at the layout

Look at [the PDF](configuration.pdf) included in this repo,
or [look at the layout in Oryx](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/PBKjJ/ZqWv6/0).
